# Contributing to Nestx

We would love for you to contribute to Nestx and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

- [Code of Conduct](#coc)
- [Question or Problem?](#question)
- [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
- [Feature Requests](#feature)
- [Submission Guidelines](#submit)
- [Development Setup](#development)
- [Coding Rules](#rules)
- [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit)

## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Help us keep Nestx open and inclusive.
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].


## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

If you have a question, you can ask us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github].

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?

You can _request_ a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to _implement_ a new feature, please submit an issue with
a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
  discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
  and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. For your issue name, please prefix your proposal with `[discussion]`, for example "[discussion]: your feature idea".
- **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using a repository. Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:

- version of NestJS used
- version of nestx-package used
- 3rd-party libraries and their versions
- and most importantly - a use-case that fails

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you we are going to close an issue that don't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by filling out our [new issue form](https://github.com/famalabs/nestx/issues/new).

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:


1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/famalabs/nestx/pulls) for an open or closed PR
   that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

2. Fork the famalabs/nestx repo.

3. Make your changes in a new git branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
   ```

4. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.

5. Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).

6. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
   [commit message conventions](#commit). Adherence to these conventions
   is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

   ```shell
   git commit -a
   ```

   Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

7. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```

8. In GitHub, send a pull request to `famalabs:master`.

- If we suggest changes then:

  - Make the required updates.
  - Re-run the checks to ensure tests are still passing.
  - Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

  ```shell
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
  ```

- Check out the master branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout master -f
  ```

- Delete the local branch:

  ```shell
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  ```

- Update your master with the latest upstream version:

  ```shell
  git pull --ff upstream master
  ```

## <a name="development"></a> Development Setup

1. After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ npm i # (or yarn install)
```

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- An automated formatter is available (`npm run format`).

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate the change log**.

### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
